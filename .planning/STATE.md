# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-13)

**Core value:** Run one command, get a complete recon picture of a target — passive, active, and vulnerability layers — with resumable checkpoints, structured output, and zero-touch tool orchestration.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Resilient Resume & Timeout Safety

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Resilient Resume & Timeout Safety) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 5
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-05-13 -- Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Audit-mode milestone first (not features) — 2026-03 audit surfaced concrete reliability/security gaps that block confident feature work
- Init: CONCERNS.md drives v1 Requirements — audit inventory already classifies severity; using it as the backlog avoids re-deriving the same list
- Roadmap: Tests sequenced AFTER resilience changes (Phase 4 follows Phase 1) so tests assert the new `.inprogress`/timeout behaviour, not the old
- Roadmap: Docs in last phase (Phase 5) so disk-space alignment reflects the settled `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB` decision rather than pre-deciding it

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
